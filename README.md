<h1>MVP Pitch</h1>
An interactive Instagram social media clone that allows a user to post photos, sound notes or articles on a web-platform. Each user post has the ability to be commented on or "liked" by other users. For other users to comment on posts, they must be following each other. In order to find users to follow, all users will have a search bar in their home navigation to use. Each user will have their own personal profile in which they have their own chosen profile picture, profile description/biography and a collection of their posts. This personal profile is viewable only by people who follow them.
